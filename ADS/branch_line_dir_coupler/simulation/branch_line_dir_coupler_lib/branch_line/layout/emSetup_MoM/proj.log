Simulation started on: Mon Nov 09 15:41:08 2015
Simulation Mode: uW
Substrate to be computed from 1.5 GHz to 1.7 GHz!
Substrate calculation started
.........|.........|.........|.........| 
Substrate calculation finished
Using the minimal snap distance of 0.0004 mm
(4 layout resolution points) for layout healing.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout healing changed the layout. The actual
highest aggregate snap distance was 0.0001 mm.
Further details have been written to the DRC
report.
